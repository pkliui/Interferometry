```BaseInterferometry``` class is the base class that provides functionality for analysis of interferometric data.
Current analysis tools:
* Fourier transform
* STFT
* Wigner-Ville transform

```Interferogram``` class is for experimental interferograms.
```Simulation``` class is for simulated interferograms.
Simulations include:
* Pulse profile
* Interferogram itself
